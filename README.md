# PS2Map Stack

This repository documents the different components of the PS2Map application, as well as an example `docker-compose.yml` file to set it all up.

Be sure to modify or override the value of `PS2MAP_SERVICE_ID` in `.env`, you won't get far with the default service ID - you can register your own [here](https://census.daybreakgames.com/#devSignup).
